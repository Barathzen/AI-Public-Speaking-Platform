Introduction:

A  Flask-based web application   improves public speaking and writing using AI techniques .  It is a combination of  speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to give real-time feedback and well -structured exercises.

Methodology:

1. AI-Powered Public Speaking Training

Exercises:

Rapid Fire Analogies: Assesses response time, fluency, and relevancy using the Gemini API and web speech recognizing model and ai generated choices). (For Rapid Analogies API key should be more the v1beta ).
Triple Step: AI monitors topic adherence and distraction handling.
Conductor: Analyzes vocal variety and energy levels using web speech recognition model.

2. Analysis and Speech Recognition:

Model Used: vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15u (lightweight, offline AutomaticSpeechRecognition model).
Processing: Uses librosa module for audio analysis, extracting pace, volume, pitch, and clarity.
Speech Features & Feedback:
oPace: Speech duration analysis suggests speed adjustments.
oVolume: Energy calculation advises speaking louder/softer using pydub,textblob and vosk.
oPitch: Frequency tracking identifies the pitch of voice and  variations.
oClarity: Silence is also detected to check fluency.

3. Evaluation of writing enhanced by AI:

Grammar & Coherence: Corrects grammar using LanguageTool & SpaCy NLP.
Sentiment & Tone Analysis: TextBlob and VADER are used to categorize sentiment.The Gemini API assesses readability and logical flow.
Essay Evaluation: Checks structure, transitions, and logical consistency.and summarizes feedback for improvement.

Findings & AI Enhancements:

AI Scoring Optimization: Fine-tuning Gemini prompts that  improves responses consistentcy.
Enhanced User Engagement: Real-time AI feedback boosts learning efficiency.
Interactive UI: Live visualization improves user experience.


Conclusion and Recommendations:

This AI-powered platform successfully integrates speech processing, LLM-based analysis, and adaptive feedback to enhance both public speaking and writing skills. Future improvements include real-time fluency scoring, AI-driven speech assessments, and expanded NLP-based text evaluation. To enhance the platform, optimizing speech recognition with noise reduction and confidence-based corrections will improve Vosk’s accuracy. AI scoring can be refined by fine-tuning Gemini API prompts and introducing adaptive difficulty. Gamification elements  will improve engagement, while new training modules like speech generation and AI-powered debate simulators will further develop public speaking and writing skills.
